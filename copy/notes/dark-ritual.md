## Boons

Dark Ritual is part of the so-called "boon cycle," a series of very useful cards, one per color, which grant three of something for one mana. White has Healing Salve (p. [X](#healing-salve)) for life, Blue has Ancestral Recall (p. [X](#ancestral-recall)) for cards, Red has Lightning Bolt (p. [X](#lightning-bolt)) for damage, and Green has Giant Growth (p. [X](#giant-growth)) for a creature boost.
