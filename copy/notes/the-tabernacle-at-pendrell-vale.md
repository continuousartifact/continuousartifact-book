## Going creatureless

While most decks feature hordes of creatures, some advanced players choose to go without, and cards like this make that strategy shine. Deploy Drop of Honey (p. [X](#drop-of-honey)) or The Abyss (p. [X](#the-abyss)) and watch your opponent's army wither away. Clean up the remainder with Wrath of God (p. [X](#wrath-of-god)) or Pestilence (p. [X](#pestilence)).
