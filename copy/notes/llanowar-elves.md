## Mana ramping

One of the key rules of _Magic_: one land per turn. But creatures like this, known as "mana dorks," let you "ramp" access to mana. For more options, see Elves of Deep Shadow (p. [X](#elves-of-deep-shadow)), Sisters of the Flame (p. [X](#sisters-of-the-flame)), and Apprentice Wizard (p. [X](#apprentice-wizard)). And don't forget the mana rocks (see p. [X](#mox-jet)).
