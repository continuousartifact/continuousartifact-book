## Tron lands

This fun trio of cards from Antiquities get radically better when you have them all in play. Use your copious colorless mana to power out an artifact-heavy "robots" deck with Triskelion (p. [X](#triskelion)) and Su-Chi (p. [X](#su-chi)). If you can afford it, add a Mishra's Workshop (p. [X](#mishras-workshop)) to ramp even faster.
