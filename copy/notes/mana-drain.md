## Control

Cards like this form the basis for the entire "control" deck archetype: rather than focus on building up your own forces, just prevent your opponent from gathering theirs! See also Control Magic (p. [X](#control-magic)), the iconic Counterspell (p. [X](#counterspell)), Power Sink (p. [X](#power-sink)), and Spell Blast (p. [X](#spell-blast)). Outside Blue, find cards like Avoid Fate (p. [X](#avoid-fate)) and Red Elemental Blast (p. [X](#red-elemental-blast)).
