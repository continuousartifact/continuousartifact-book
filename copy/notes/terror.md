Just as important as playing your own cards, often, is getting rid of your opponentsâ€™. "Removal" spells like this are an essential part of any _Magic_ deck. For more, see Divine Offering (p. [X](#divine-offering)), Shatter (p. [X](#shatter)), Swords to Plowshares (p. [X](#swords-to-plowshares)), and the iconic Chaos Orb (p. [X](#chaos-orb)).
