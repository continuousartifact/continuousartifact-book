## Mana rocks

Like the mana dorks (see p. [X](#llanowar-elves)), these let you "ramp" your mana, allowing you to cast bigger cards more quickly. Besides the "moxen," as they are affectionately known, see Mana Vault (p. [X](#mana-vault)), Sol Ring (p. [X](#sol-ring)), the mana-fixing Fellwar Stone (p. [X](#fellwar-stone)), and the granddaddy of them all: Black Lotus (p. [X](#black-lotus)).
