## Poison

If whittling away your opponent's 20 life seems too ordinary, OSM includes two "alternate win" rules, including loading them up with 10 poison counters using this card, Pit Scorpion (p. [X](#pit-scorpion)), and Serpent Generator (p. [X](#serpent-generator)). (For the other alt-win, see Millstone, p. [X](#millstone).)
