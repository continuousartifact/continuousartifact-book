## X spells

"X spells," which require a variable mana cost, produce some of the most dramatic moments in _Magic_. Draw cards with Braingeyser (p. [X](#braingeyser)), do damage with Disintegrate (p. [X](#disintegrate)), gain life with Stream of Life (p. [X](#stream-of-life)), or force your opponent to discard with Mind Twist (p. [X](#mind-twist)), the most widely reviled card in OSM.
