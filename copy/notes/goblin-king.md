## Tribal

"Lord" cards like this one are the centerpiece of "tribal" decks, bestowing a special bonus upon all creatures of a certain type. Beyond goblins, try zombies with the Zombie Master (p. [X](#zombie-master)) or mermaids with the Lord of Atlantis (p. [X](#lord-of-atlantis), and see the deck on p. [X](#deck-U)).
