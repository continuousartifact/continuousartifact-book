## Mana fixing

You're playing a multi-color deck, but you keep drawing the wrong lands! What to do? Hopefully you've included some "mana-fixing" cards to get you the right color mana when you need it. Beyond the iconic Birds, try City of Brass (p. [X](#city-of-brass)), Fellwar Stone (p. [X](#fellwar-stone)), and the so-called "dual lands" (see Badlands, p. [X](#badlands)).
