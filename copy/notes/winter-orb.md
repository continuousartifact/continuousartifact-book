## Prison

This card is central to the "prison" strategy: prevent your opponent from doing basically anything at all, while you wait to draw a card like Black Vise (p. [X](#black-vise)) for the win. Use Icy Manipulator (p. [X](#icy-manipulator)) or Relic Barrier (p. [X](#relic-barrier)) to tap the Orb during your turn so _you_ get to untapâ€”and try Howling Mine (p. [X](#howling-mine)) to accelerate your opponent's demise.
