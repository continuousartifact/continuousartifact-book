## The Factory

Perhaps the most commonly played card in OSM other than basic lands, this shapeshifter sneaks to the front lines as an attacker when it's not busy producing mana. As a blocker, it can give _itself_ +1/+1 and take out many foes. Unusually for OSM, there are four versions of this card with different art, one for each season.
