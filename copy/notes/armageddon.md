## Board wipes

Armageddon, Balance (p. [X](#balance)), and Wrath of God (p. [X](#wrath-of-god)) are some of the most powerful cards in the game: they "wipe the board" of lands, creatures, and even cards in your hand. While White is the king of board wipes, see also Green's Tranquility (p. [X](#tranquility), enchantments) and Red's Shatterstorm (p. [X](#shatterstorm), artifacts).
