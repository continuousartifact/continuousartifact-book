The childhood of my memory was filled with _Magic: the Gathering_. Wild neverending games late into the night—or at least until bedtime. Buying a cheap lockbox with friends so we could bring our cards to summer camp without them getting stolen. Getting swindled for my "boring" dual lands (p. [X](#badlands)) by the Spanish teacher's son in a trade for his tantalizing Leviathan (p. [X](#leviathan)).

Looking back, it seems like an eternity. Weekly visits to The Darkside, Pegasus Games, or The Dugout in my hometown of Madison, Wisconsin. Reading every issue of _Scrye_ I could get my hands on. Tearing open booster packs. Salivating over the Black Lotus (p. [X](#black-lotus)) in the glass case, trying to figure out why it was so powerful, but in any case knowing I could never save up the $100 they wanted.

Decades later, I was surprised to work out that my friends and I collected and played _Magic_ for only little more than a year, starting around July 1994. We began with Revised Starter Decks, we remember the excitement when The Dark was released, and we stopped after Ice Age but before Homelands.

How is it possible, I now wonder, that a year inside the world of Urza and Mishra could consume my childhood memories like this?

Early _Magic_ cards, from Alpha (Aug 1993) to Fallen Empires (Nov 1994), represent a special moment in gaming history. By modern-day standards, these $card_count cards range from wildly underpowered to, some would say, broken. But the raw genius of game creator Richard Garfield and his small band of friends produced a creative torrent so rich and full of joy that this short stack of cards continues to captivate players old and new even today.

The beauty of Old School Magic (OSM), as it is called, is that while this set of cards will never change, frozen in time, there are always new discoveries to be had: tricky combinations, diamonds in the rough, new ways of looking at cards once considered unimportant.

OSM tournaments are held every month all around the world. And while the "Power Nine" (see p. [X](#formats)), unattainable to mere mortals like me, are featured in many winning decks, you will also see familiar faces from your own arsenal: Savannah Lions (p. [X](#savannah-lions)), Lightning Bolt (p. [X](#lightning-bolt)), Giant Growth (p. [X](#giant-growth)).

My hope with this book is to reawaken memories of casting your own first _Magic_ spells on the sidewalk or kitchen table. It's time to dig your cards out of the closet. Flip through the pages ahead to find the fearsome creatures and wicked enchantments you always wished you had—they're probably cheaper than you think. Or if the game is new to you, it's never too late to start. Throw together a couple decks, enlist a friend, and clear off a spot on the carpet: it's time for _Magic_.

Browsing the pages of this book makes my imagination run wild, filling me with the thrill of discovery just as these cards did decades ago. On one page, I'll find an offbeat synergy; on another, a novel answer to a bothersome threat. I'll land on a single peculiar card and, before I know it, a deck concept starts to materialize in my mind—almost certainly unsound, but who cares. The card names, iconic art, and flavor text conjure a mighty world that is both deeply familiar and somehow always new.

I have come to think of these first glimmers from the dawn of _Magic_ as an artifact to be treasured—and played, again and again, late into the night. Every single card has a story, and each has a place of honor in a deck you just haven't gotten around to building yet.
