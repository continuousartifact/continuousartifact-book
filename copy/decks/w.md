Home of the iconic Serra Angel (p. [X](#serra-angel)), white is known for its thematic and mechanical commitment to peace and structure, with its cast of characters working as a group to defeat the enemy. White is great at removing specific threats with cards like Swords to Plowshares (p. [X](#swords-to-plowshares)) and Disenchant (p. [X](#disenchant))—or even "wiping the board" with Armageddon (p. [X](#armageddon)), Wrath of God (p. [X](#wrath-of-god)), or Balance (p. [X](#balance)). Mechanics like banding, first strike, protection, and life gain round out the flavor.

## White Weenies

White is perhaps most famous for its "weenie" creatures—low casting cost, relatively high impact—exemplified by the ubiquitous Savannah Lions (p. [X](#savannah-lions)). Cast your creatures one after another and use Crusade (p. [X](#crusade)) to win before your opponent has even gotten started. Use the deck on this spread as a starting point and add your own individual flair.
