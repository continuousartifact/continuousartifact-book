Embodied by the iconic Counterspell (p. [X](#counterspell)), blue would rather control how the game unfolds than win it right away. Surprise spells, manipulation of time, and card theft are all tricks up blue's sleeve. When _Magic_ was first released, blue was radically overpowered—the only colored cards in the "Power Nine" (see p. [X](#formats)) were blue: Ancestral Recall (p. [X](#ancestral-recall)), Timetwister (p. [X](#timetwister)), and Time Walk (p. [X](#time-walk)).

## Merfolk

This is a classic example of a "tribal" deck—several creatures with type "Merfolk" are improved by one or more Lords of Atlantis (p. [X](#lord-of-atlantis), which according to modern rules is _also_ a Merfolk, although it does not affect itself). Turn your opponent's lands into Islands with Phantasmal Terrain (p. [X](#phantasmal-terrain)) to enable the islandwalk ability, not to mention Seasinger's (p. [X](#seasinger)) creature-stealing trick.
