More amoral than evil, black uses death, destruction, and mayhem to win the game. Graveyard tricks, discard effects, and plentiful creature removal—such as with the classic Terror (p. [X](#terror))—combine with a splash of direct damage (Drain Life, p. [X](#drain-life)) to beat down the opposition. There is possibly no card more feared in OSM than a well-timed Mind Twist (p. [X](#mind-twist)).

## Mono Black Rack

The goal of this terrifying deck is to force you to discard your hand with Hypnotic Specter (p. [X](#hypnotic-specter)), Hymn to Tourach (p. [X](#hymn-to-tourach)), Disrupting Scepter (p. [X](#disrupting-scepter)), and Mind Twist, which combine to activate The Rack's (p. [X](#the-rack)) devastating effect. The famous first turn with this deck is to use a Dark Ritual (p. [X](#dark-ritual)) to cast a Hypnotic Specter: your opponent might as well resign.
