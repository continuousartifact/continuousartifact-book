The beautifully scanned card images in this book were made for the community by a group of rascals going by the name CCGHQ. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their immense ongoing effort to digitally archive every single _Magic_ card ever printed.

The "gamma" card scans in the image opposite the title page were collected from all over the internet, but my understanding is that many of them were originally made by the heroic TheMisprintGuy—thank you.

Thanks to the illustrious Greg T, who runs the @oldschoolmtg Instagram account, for all of his expert feedback and especially for suggesting the representative decks for each color (although flaws in the specific brews printed here are my fault, not his). And to Scott Gemegnani, owner of the Tinker & Smithy game shop in Middlebury, Vermont—you and your store helped reawaken my long-dormant love of this game.

Thanks, Dad, as always, for the copyediting.

The data underlying the card pages comes from two sources: Scryfall and MTGJSON. Both are invaluable resources for the _Magic_ community, and I am grateful for their work. Prices are from TCGPlayer, Card Kingdom, Cardsphere, and Cardmarket. Card power rankings are courtesy EDHREC.

This book was programmatically generated using Ruby and the phenomenal Weasyprint library.
