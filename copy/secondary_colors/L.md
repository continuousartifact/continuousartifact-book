# Land

The cornerstone of any deck, lands (generally) produce mana. Start with the basic lands: Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. Then see the sought-after "dual lands" (e.g. Badlands, p. [X](#badlands)). Later expansions would innovate extensively with lands, like the game-changing Library of Alexandria (p. [X](#library-of-alexandria)) from Arabian Nights and tricky Maze of Ith (p. [X](#maze-of-ith)) from The Dark. The shape-shifting Mishra's Factory (p. [X](#mishras-factory)) from Antiquities is an ever-present staple of OSM.
