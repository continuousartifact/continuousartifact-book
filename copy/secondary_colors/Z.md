# Multicolor

When _Magic_'s third expansion set, Legends, arrived in 1994, fans tearing open their first boosters had their minds blown: golden cards that required mana of multiple colors to cast. In this set, all gold cards were special "legendary" creatures, many modeled after their creator's RPG characters. Other sets would expand the multicolor concept into additional types and rarities.
