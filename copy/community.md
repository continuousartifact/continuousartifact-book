Old School Magic is blessed with a thriving community of players, collectors, and fans spanning the globe. Whether you're new to the scene or a format stalwart, there's always more to discover. Here are a few ways to get involved.

## Watch great matches on YouTube

Start with the excellent _Timmy Talks_ channel. Timmy covers seemingly every OSM tournament on the planet, and in between hosts webcam games with players of all skill levels. Before each match, Timmy shares "deck tech"—a breakdown of the deck explaining all of the key cards and thematic combinations the player will aim for.

Watching these games is a great way to get a feel for OSM's current metagame…and start drooling for the powerful cards you (and I) can't afford. If you appreciate Timmy's content, please do consider supporting him on his Patreon. If you do, he'll even play _you_ and put the match on his channel.

## Join the fray on Discord

OSM is in the goldilocks zone of online communities—big enough that there's always something going on, small enough that anyone can join. And you'll find that veterans and newbies alike welcome new enthusiasts with open arms.

The scene's main hub is the OldSchoolMTG server, which includes special channels for beginners, "deck tech" discussions, and organizing webcam games. (I also recommend Timmy Talks's server.) Wherever you start, just dive in! Ask questions, share deck ideas, and set up some play.

## Get some reps at your LGS

Wherever you live, odds are there's a local game shop (LGS) waiting for you to walk through the door. While you will see mostly contemporary _Magic_ sets and cards on display, just ask to see their 93/94 singles to get the conversation going. The owner may be able to connect you with other OSM players in the area, or check the store's event calendar to show up and evangelize.

## Compete online

While it's a far cry from how we played in 1994, using your paper cards for online matches is easy and more fun than you'd think. Just point your laptop's webcam down at your desk! One great way to get started is to join one of the monthly "X-Points" tournaments. This approachable format assigns points to powerful and expensive cards, and you're only allowed to have 10 (X) points in your deck. That means even a budget deck can win. Join their Discord server to get started.

## Join a local or regional OSM group

From Chicago's Lords of the Pit to Montreal's Tundra Wolves to the original community in Sweden, there are OSM gatherings all over the world. The Chaos Orb, an OSM website, maintains a good list to browse.

## Enter an IRL tournament

The largest organized event each year is Lobstercon in Boston, hosted by New England Old School (NEOS). This event uses Atlantic rules and the permissive EC reprint policy (see p. [X](#formats)) and always features card artists and other "celebrities" from the scene.

Other top events include the Uthden Troll Cup, Knights of Thorn, and the Raging Bull Series in the Netherlands; n00bcon and the Arvika Festival in Sweden; winc0n in Genoa, Italy; and the Tundra Wolves Challenge in Montreal, Canada.

Ask in one of the Discords if you can't find an event nearby, or there's also the online Summer and Winter Derby events to try.
